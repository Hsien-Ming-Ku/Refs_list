# Refs_list
This file for the authors provides some references, which are not easy to be obtained via some journal databases. 
So here we make them easily available for our researchers, who are interested in our work.

# Main context;
Note: "stephens.ps" is the PS file of the reference "D. Stephens, ELMRES: An Oblique Projection Method To Solve Sparse Non-Symmetric Linear
Systems (Ph.D dissertation), Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, USA (1999)."

# Updated news:
Since Prof. Gary Howell (a very kind and great scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aveeuC8AAAAJ&hl=en) 
had retired from North Carolina State University, it found that his offical homepage was no longer unavailable for 
accessing the files named "stephens.ps" and "elmres320.ps", but these two files are very essential for my research development 
on the iterative algorithms based on the Hessenberg procedure. So, in order to make them available for my research studies, 
I post them here.
